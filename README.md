## ðŸš€ Features

- Predicts diabetes (positive/negative) using user input
- Trained using standard ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Simple and responsive web form interface
- Easily deployable with Flask
- Extendable for cloud deployment (Heroku, Render, etc.)

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning

- **Algorithm Used**: Logistic Regression (you can swap with others)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values (0s replaced with NaN)
  - Feature scaling (optional)
  - Train-test split
